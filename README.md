# clocking-in-again
A clock made using p5js for MIT 4.032 Information and Visualization.
A second clock with geometric forms and simple lines. 
Each circle is tangent to the edge of the rectangle.
When the hour, minute and second hand are aligned they look like three stacked circles tangent to one another on a telescope-like shape.
I can see this being used as a phone wallpaper or a desktop widget.
